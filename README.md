<h1>CaptchaConverter</h1>

As pentesters we all had at least one test where  we all needed to use Base64 Image converters online which took an extra efort of copying things and sometimes we were running out of time. Captcha Converter is making that process really easy .
It opens a Tab named “CaptchaConverter” at anywhere you can see the response which has JSON object it doesn’t matter if it is Proxy, Repeater or Http History. 
Captcha Converter tab also include response with rendered image! If you need to see any information from response you don’t need to go back and forth for that!

Now I am going tos how some examples to see;
Just go to “Captcha Converter” Tab;
